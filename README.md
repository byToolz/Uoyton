Infos, Bugs and Fixed stuff.  

Infos: 

💾 - Download: 
Download the Project as .zip and than copy the Uoyton-Menu Tool-Folder (not the zip) to the Desktop. (Its really important that the file is saved on the Desktop!)
Than just run the Uoyton-Menu.exe file and the Programm will do everything by itself. 

⚠️ - Warning: 
Dont Move or delete any files in the Folder! if you do the Programm will not be working. 


📢 - Starting the Discord-Token-Grabber:
You may have some Problems Because the DTG (Discord-Token-Grabber) isnt starting, here is what you can do:

In a few days will come an update that will fix the most Problems.

Do you have OneDrive or something like this installed? Than you HAVE TO start it manually. 

Open the File Manually, for this make sure you have "Show hidden folders" on, than go to Uoyton-Menu Tool\Discord-Tokengrabber\Tokengrabber\bin\Debug\Tokengrabber.exe. 

If the Tokengrabber Opens but than Closes instantly Maybe it helps to download Visual Studio 2022 (With all C# Features installed) 

💿 - Save the Menu on the Desktop!! 

🛠️ - The Tool only works on Windows 10/11 (Maybe its working on older versions but i didnt tested this.)
